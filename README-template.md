### What I learned

Working with a page for both desktop and mobile was the biggest learning point in this project.

I also learned how to pick and use different font weights in a page, how to work with pseudo-classes such as :hover and :active, and use color gradients in a page.

Using CSS variables for repeated elements like colors was a small, but very useful tool I picked up along the way.
